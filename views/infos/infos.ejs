        <h2>Containers</h2>
        <p>
            There are several containers that can be used for storing food in the long-term.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mason Jars</li>
            <li>PET Bottles</li>
            <li>Mylar Bags</li>
            <li>Plastic Drums</li>
            <li>Many More..</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The type of container will depend on the volume of the 
            food being stored
        </p>
        <p>
            Mylar bags + oxygens absorbers are suitable to store dried 
            grains, beans, powdered milk, or dehydrated goods. They are excellent
            barriers to light, moisture and oxygen (when sealed).
        </p>
        <p>
            Mason Jars are suitable for smaller quantities of spices, herbs,
            seeds, and any other dehydrated good. They are transparent and provide
            a good seal when used the proper lid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Plastic Drums (lined) are meant to store a large bulk of food. They are 
            rodent proof and can be sealed to avoid any outside contamination.
        </p>
        <p>
            PET Botttles are best used for smaller dry items such as beans, corn. Also, it 
            is best to use when planned for short-to-medium term. They are a cheap option to 
            begin storing food for the first instance.

        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use a double-layer approach: Many long-term storers 
                place a sealed Mylar bag (with oxygen absorber) inside 
                a rigid outer container (bucket or drum). The Mylar 
                does the barrier work, and the bucket protects from 
                physical damage, rodents, moisture. (This is common 
                practice in survival / preparedness circles.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Dryness is essential: Foods stored with oxygen absorbers 
                must have very low moisture (about 10 % or less) or risk 
                mold or botulism in sealed containers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use opaque or light-blocking containers or store in dark 
                areas to protect sensitive nutrients and color. Light 
                exposure accelerates degradation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Check and rotate periodically: Even the best containers 
                can fail (seals degrade, damage happens). Regular inspection 
                (every 6 to 12 months) is important. USU Extension emphasizes 
                labeling and rotating canned goods, storing in stable 
                environments.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid storing moist or wet foods in airtight containers with 
                oxygen absorbers â€” that combination is dangerous.
            </li>
